# FedVSR: Towards Model-Agnostic Federated Learning in Video Super-Resolution


This is the official repository for **FedVSR** which contains code and experiments, a method to train Video Super-Resolution (VSR) models under the Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. The goal is to enable high-quality VSR while ensuring data privacy by not centralizing raw video data.


## Key Contributions

✅ Introduced a **model-agnostic and stateless FL framework** for VSR

✅ Developed a **3D Discrete Wavelet Transform-based loss function** to preserve high-frequency details and enhance reconstruction quality.

✅ Proposed a **loss-aware weighted aggregation** method.

✅ Achieved superior PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS across multiple VSR models and datasets.

✅ First framework addressing **Federated Learning for VSR**.


## Project Overview

- **What is FedVSR?**  
  FedVSR is a federated training framework that allows multiple clients to train a shared video super-resolution model without sharing their raw data. This approach preserves data privacy and is suitable for scenarios where raw video footage is sensitive.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/alimd94/FedVSR.git
      cd FedVSR

2. **Set up Python environment**  
     ```bash
      python3 -m venv fedvsr_env
      source fedvsr_env/bin/activate  
      pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install -r requirements.txt

    

## Prepare Data:

To prepare the dataset, follow [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR/blob/master/docs/DatasetPreparation.md#Video-Super-Resolution). After completing the preparation, the directory structure should be as follows: 

```
datasets/
├──REDS/
│   └──val_REDS4_sharp
│   └──val_REDS4_sharp_bicubic
```

## Training

For VRT and RVRT prepare the related json in the file and the run the scripts:
```bash
# VSR trained on FedAvg
python VRTandRVRT/vrt_and_rvrt_fedavg.py
# VSR trained on FedVSR
python VRTandRVRT/vrt_and_rvrt_fedvsr.py
```

For IART:
```bash
# VSR trained on FedAvg
python IART/iart_fedavg.py
# VSR trained on FedVSR
python IART/iart_fedvsr.py
```

## Testing

You can test using 2 different datasets VID4 and REDS:
```bash
python VRTandRVRT/main_test_rvrt.py 

python VRTandRVRT/main_test_vrt.py 
```

To test IART you would use:

```bash
python IART/test_scripts/test_IART_REDS4_N6.py 
python IART/test_scripts/test_IART_Vid4_N6.py
```
